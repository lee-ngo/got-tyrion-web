Muttering along the way to The Wall, you travel with JON SNOW, bastard son of Eddard 'Ned' Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. Jon has opted to 'take the black,' a colloquialism for those who pledge their lives to The Night's Watch.
</p>
<p>
At a rest stop, Jon stares at you as you read a book. You look up for a moment, smile politely, and return to the book.
