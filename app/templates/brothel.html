    Ah, there's nothing quite like a brothel! The charm of the Northern women is enough to thaw the frost you've been feeling since you've arrived.
  </p>
  <p>
  The madam of the establishment, ROS, walks out in a flowing robe that leaves very little to the imagination. She claps her hands and a row of young maidens walks into the main room, one more beautiful than the last.
  </p>
  <p>
  Ros: "Lord Tyrion, welcome! Which of these fine ladies do you choose?"
  </p>
  <p>
  Do you select ROS or a RANDOM woman?

  <p>
    Ros blushes at the audacity of your choice. "Lord Tyrion, you flatter me. However, I cannot abide. I'm afraid the madam of the house is not for sale."
  </p>
  <p>
    You: "Everything's for sale, milady. Especially when you're a Lannister."

  <p>
    You throw an additional bag of gold on the table. Ros' eyes widen. "Very well, milord. Please come with me."
  </p>
  <p>
  You walk with raised anticipation to a private room with Ros. As she undresses in front of you, you feel a swell of excitement and pour more wine.

    BOOM! Your brother JAIME storms into the room. Perfect timing as always.

    Jaime: "Forgive me, little brother. Pressing matters at hand."
  </p>
  <p>
    You: "You are certainly not forgiven. What could it be, Ser Jaime?"
  </p>
  <p>
    Jaime: "You've been asked to join the party heading to The Wall."

   </p>
   <p>
    Jaime: "Meet with the Night's Watch. Provide a full report to the Small Council upon your return to King's Landing."
   </p>
   <p>
    You sigh and begin to gather your clothes. Ros looks back at you, confused. "And now my watch begins...."

    A young maiden escorts you to one of their finest rooms. Before you remove your clothes, however, the maiden pulls out a DAGGER and SLITS YOUR THROAT!

  Before taking all of your gold, she looks down upon your slowly draining corpse and smiles wickedly.
  </p>
  <p>
  Woman: "A Lannister always pays his debts."
  </p>
  <p>
  Turns out you choose the one woman who had a score to settle with your family a long time ago.
