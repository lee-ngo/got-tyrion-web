  <h2>You lose...</h2>
    <p>
      With one fell swoop, Bronn was defeated by Ser Vardis. The court of The Vale cheers as they throw Bronn's body print out the moon door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lysa: "The gods have spoken, and justice will be served to my dear sister Catelyn."
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldiers of The Vale grab you as well. You pray that you will land on Bronn's body... not that it will matter.

  <h2>You win!</h2>
  <p>With a decisive blow, Bronn stabs Ser Vardis through his neck and kicks his body through the Moon Door. You clench your fists in triumph.
  </p>
  <p>
  Lysa: (gasping) "You fight without honor!"

  <p>
  Bronn shrugs and points out the Moon Door.
  </p>
  <p>
  Bronn walks over to you and finally frees your hands.
  </p>
  <p>
  Bronn: "Shall we head home now, milord?"
