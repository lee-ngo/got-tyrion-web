    <p>
    You begin your journey riding with your family and in-laws to Winterfell, your first time traveling to the North part of Westeros.
    </p>
    <p>
    You ride up to WINTERFELL, the keep that maintains order in the North for centuries. The frigid air does not suit you, and you feel a tingling in your loins.
    </p>
    <p>
    Do you talk to JON SNOW and head with him to The Wall, or do you go to a BROTHEL to ease your troubled mind?"
