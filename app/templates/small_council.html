      You walk with Littlefinger to the room of the Small Council, perhaps the most powerful group in all of the Seven Kingdoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      <div>Members of the Small Council include:</div>
      <div>- PYCELLE, Grand Maester</div>
      <div>- VARYS, Master of Whisperers</div>
      <div>- STANNIS, Master of Ships</div>
      <div>- RENLY, Master of Laws</div>
      <div>- LITTLEFINGER, Master of Coin</div>
    </p>
    <p>
      You notice that the table of the Small Council has one chair that is noticeably vacant: The Hand of the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pycelle: "Lord Tyrion. Welcome. We have been expecting you."
    </p>

      You: "It is an honor to be in the presence of such esteemed members of the Small Council. Forgive me if I still struggle to understand the meaning of my invitation here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Varys: "We've been watching you for quite some time, Lord Tyrion. My spiders everywhere have kept track of you since you rode off to Winterfell not too long ago."

      Renly: "Indeed. While you may not be perfect, there aren't many of us alive who have less ... quirks."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stannis: "...Fewer."
    </p>

      Renly rolls his eyes at his older brother's obsession with proper grammar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Littlefinger: "To get to the point, the Kingdom needs someone with your cunning and insight to lead it out of a potentially dark time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pycelle: "Lord Tyrion, we need you to serve as Hand of the King."
    </p>
    <p>
      You are shocked. Surely they must be mistaken. You, Tyrion Lannister, unwanted son of Tywin Lannister, frequenter of brothels and wine... this is whom they want as Hand?

      You: "Forgive me, gentlemen... but doesn't the position currently belong to Ned Stark?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Renly: "Yes, but... let's just say Stark is a bit too..."
    </p>
    <p>
      Littlefinger: "Trusting."
    </p>
    <p>
      Varys: "What the kingdom needs is someone who knows all the angles and how to play them properly. That person is you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pycelle: "I think we've discussed enough. What do you think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you ACCEPT or DECLINE the position of Hand of the King?
    </p>
    <button id="accept-hand">ACCEPT</button>
    <button class="next-scene-click">DECLINE</button>

      Pycelle: "What an insult! I knew he could not be trusted!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Stannis: "Indeed. Let's burn him at the stake."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes you should take an offer you can't refuse.

  <p>
    And so, Tyrion Lannister, son of Tywin Lannister, was named Hand of the King. With the support of multiple houses, he managed to lead Westeros into a new era of peace and prosperity, only to be overwhelmed by a frozen zombie army from beyond The Wall and an orphan blonde woman commanding three dragons and a barbarian horde."
